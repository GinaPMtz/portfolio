            <h2>Masala Shakespeare</h2>
            <img> </img>
            <p>“Masala Shakespeare” is an undergraduate research project that I wrote alongside Dr. Gusain. This project 
            showcased the universality and portability of Shakespeare’s plays through Bollywood 
            films by focusing on Indian cinematic adaptations of <em>Romeo and Juliet, Othello,</em> and <em>Hamlet</em>. This project was 
            presented at the Student Creative Activity & Research Forum (SCARF) on April 14, 2023, and won an award for 
            Outstanding Achievement in Creative Activity and Research. </p>

            <h2>Time</h2>
            <img> </img>
            <p>“Time” is a collage made through Adobe Photoshop. It is comprised of five images and in black and white. 
            This piece was inspired by the fast-moving environment that many students currently live in and the constant
            feeling of not having enough time. “Time” hopes to encourage others to take the time to slow down and take a 
            look around. This project was shown at the 2023 New Media Spring Student Juried Exhibition at the University 
            of North Carolina Asheville in March 31. </p>
