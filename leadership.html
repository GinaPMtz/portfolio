        <section id="about">
            <p>
            The UNCA Leadership Scholars Program (LSP) is a premier four-year student leadership development program 
            at UNC Asheville. This cohort-based program of ten scholars each year is designed to help students maximize
            their leadership skills through self-discovery, experiential learning, and career readiness. During their 
            four years in the program, scholars critically examine leadership systems and structures in order to take 
            action on issues that matter to them. Scholars engage with a variety of thought leaders across disciplines 
            and build deep connections with fellow UNCA students, faculty, staff, and alumni. The program requires bi-weekly 
            participation for a variety of learning opportunities. Scholars are expected to commit at least two hours per 
            week to program components.
