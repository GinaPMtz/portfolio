    <h1>&#10047; About Me &#10047;</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Georgina.</p>
    <p> I am a first-year student at the University of North Carolina Asheville. I am currently pursuing a degree in 
        New Media, with a minor in English. During my time here at UNCA, I have gotten involved with the community in 
        multiple ways such as serving on the board for Prospanica, joining multiple clubs and organizations. This is 
        because I am strong believer in building community and in the importance of social justice. 
        I have always loved learning about new and unfamiliar subjects even when I was young. New Media allows for me
         to combine my interest in coding along with my artistic intrigue. English allows me to explore new forms of 
         reading and analyzing text, along with developing my own writing and communication capabilities. 
        In the future I would love to work within the web design and maybe even the publishing industry. 
        I can’t wait to see what the future will hold!
